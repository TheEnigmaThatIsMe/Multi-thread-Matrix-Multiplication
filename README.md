# Multi-thread-Matrix-Multiplication
A C program that performs matrix multiplication using multiple threads

run 'make check' to compile and run the test file

run 'make analyze' to compile and run the analysis program

plot.gnu creates a plot.png that shows the performance of the matrix multiplication in relation to how many threads are being used.

Read the project3.pdf for more details about what specifically had to be implemented.
